# Cyclone-Analysis

Developed a data analytics model to identify tropical cyclone centers using wind stress, wind curl, 
and divergence analysis techniques. Employed with wind components data from EOS-6 satellite's 
scatteromter L2B data in HDF5 format, applying advanced analytics methodologies to interpret 
patterns and streamline cyclone center detection. Integration of these techniques enhanced 
accuracy and efficiency in forecasting cyclone formation and behavior.
